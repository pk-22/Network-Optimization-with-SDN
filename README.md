# Network-Optimization-with-SDN
# Overview
Developed and deployed a custom network topology that contains 10 nodes with diverse link delays (1ms - 5ms) and 50Mb bandwidth using Mininet and RYU controller.
Developed a RYU controller program to automatically discover the network topology, calculate link costs based on traversed time, and compute optimal paths for all host pairs.
Implemented user interaction for dynamic connection requests, considering source, destination, service type (IPv4 or MAC), and bandwidth (1-5Mb). Generated and applied configuration updates on intermediate switches along the path.
